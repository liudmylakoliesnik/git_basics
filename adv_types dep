"""Calculate deposit percent yield based on time period.

Imagine your friend wants to put money on a deposit.
He has got many offers from different banks:
- First bank declares +A% each day;
- Second bank promises +B% each month;
- Third bank offers +C% by the end of the year;
- The 4th bank promotes +D% in a 10-year term;
- ... and so on ...

Your friend gets a terrible headache calculating all this stuff,
and asks you to help checking everything. You quickly realize
it is a common task and having a simple script is a great idea.

Let's implement this.

A simplified task:
Given the SUM amount of money, and PERCENT yield promised in a
FIXED_PERIOD of time, calculate the TOTAL equivalent of money
in a SET_PERIOD of time.

Math formula:
p = PERCENT / 100
TOTAL = SUM * ((1 + p) ** (SET_PERIOD / FIXED_PERIOD))

# TODO: change the script to output the 1-year percent yield

# TODO: (extra) Output only percents if the initial SUM is
